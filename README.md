# Template-Kotlin-Android-CleanMVVM

A modular, scalable Android architecture template built with Kotlin, following **MVVM** and **Clean Architecture** principles.  
This template provides a clean, maintainable, and testable foundation for Android projects using modern tools like Coroutines, Flow, Hilt, Retrofit, and Room.

Ideal for developers who want a robust starting point to build production-ready apps with a well-organized codebase.

> **Note:** This repository is marked as a [GitHub Template Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository).  
> You can use the **"Use this template"** button to generate a new repository with this exact structure and setup — perfect for starting your own Android projects quickly.

## ✨ Features

- Clean and modular folder structure
- Predefined base setup for MVVM and Clean Architecture
- Built with Kotlin DSL and best practices

## 🧱 Architecture

This template follows the principles of [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/The-Clean-Architecture.html) by Uncle Bob, ensuring a decoupled and testable structure. It uses the MVVM pattern at the presentation layer and separates concerns via modular layers.

### Layers

- **Presentation (`app`)**: UI, ViewModels, Hilt injection setup
- **Domain**: UseCases, business logic, entities (independent of Android SDK)
- **Data**: Repositories, mappers, data sources
- **Remote**: Handles API interaction via Retrofit
- **Cache**: Local database layer using Room
